Use the `m2-remediate` skill, forwarding these arguments verbatim: $ARGUMENTS

Do not collapse the per-batch approval gate, execute a `gate: manual` finding, or skip the
closure diff unless `--no-closure` was passed. The skill's batch gate and its
never-count-an-unverified-batch-clean rule apply unchanged.
