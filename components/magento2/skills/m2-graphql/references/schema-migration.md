# Schema Migration

Strategy for evolving a GraphQL schema without breaking clients.

## Non-Breaking Changes (Safe)

- Adding a new query, mutation, or type
- Adding a new optional argument to an existing operation
- Adding a new field to an existing type (existing queries continue to work without
  requesting the new field)
- Adding a new enum value (clients that don't recognize it get an error if they request
  it; clients that don't request it are unaffected)
- Adding a new union member

## Breaking Changes (Require BC Process)

- Removing a query, mutation, type, field, or enum value
- Renaming any of the above
- Changing a field's type
- Changing an optional argument to required
- Changing a list field to non-list (or vice versa)
- Removing a `@resolver` directive

## BC Process

For each breaking change:

1. **Deprecate first**:
   ```graphql
   field: String @deprecated(reason: "use newField instead — removed in 2.0")
   ```
2. **Wait** at least one minor version.
3. **Remove** in a major-version bump.

Magento's GraphQL framework respects `@deprecated`: clients querying the deprecated
field still get data; introspection shows the deprecation reason.

## UPGRADE.md

Every breaking change goes in `{ctx.magento_root}/app/code/{Vendor}/{Module}/UPGRADE.md` per the
`m2-upgrade` BC-break-notification format.

## Schema Merge Conflict

If two modules add the same field to the same type:

```graphql
# Module A
type Customer { custom_field: String }
# Module B
type Customer { custom_field: Int }
```

The last-loaded module wins, but Magento's schema compiler emits a warning. Resolve by
renaming one of the fields.

## Adding to Magento Core Types

You may extend `Customer`, `Product`, `Cart`, etc. from your module:

```graphql
type Customer {
    {vendor_lower}_loyalty_points: Int @resolver(class: "\\{Vendor}\\Loyalty\\Model\\Resolver\\Points")
}
```

This is safe and the recommended pattern. Use a vendor prefix to avoid colliding with
other modules.

## Versioning Resolvers

If a resolver's behaviour changes (e.g. tax calculation method), and old clients depend
on the old behaviour:

1. Create a new field with the new behaviour: `total_v2: Float`.
2. Mark the old field deprecated.
3. Migrate clients.
4. Remove the old field after one minor version.

## Schema Introspection

In dev mode, clients can query `__schema` to discover types. Disable introspection in
production for security:

```php
// In a custom GraphQL middleware
// Reject queries containing __schema or __type when in production mode.
```

Magento doesn't disable introspection by default — consider adding a plugin to do so for
public deployments.

## Testing Schema Compatibility

Magento has no built-in GraphQL schema-diff command. To catch unintended breaking
changes before a release, compare the schema across versions yourself:

- **Diff the SDL in version control** — `schema.graphqls` files are committed, so a
  plain `git diff` between the release tag and `HEAD` over `**/schema.graphqls` surfaces
  removed/renamed fields, type changes, and newly-required arguments.
- **Compare introspection output** — run the GraphQL introspection query against the old
  and new builds and diff the results, which also captures fields added by other modules
  that merge into the same types.

Treat any removal, rename, type change, or optional→required argument change as breaking
(see the Breaking Changes list above).
