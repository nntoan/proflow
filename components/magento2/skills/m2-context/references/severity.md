# Severity Scale (Shared)

The five-point severity scale used by **every** findings-producing skill in this pack:
`m2-review`, `m2-security`, `m2-perf-audit`,
`m2-upgrade`. Each consumer may add skill-specific calibration anchors;
the *meanings* of the levels are shared.

## Levels

| Level        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Critical** | Exploitable auth/payment/data-loss issue, RCE, secret leak, or deployment-breaking defect. Block release; fix immediately.                                                     |
| **High**     | Security bypass, broken public API, unsafe state mutation, serious data integrity issue, or DI/schema issue likely to break production. Block release; fix before merge.       |
| **Medium**   | Magento architectural violation, missing validation, maintainability issue likely to cause defects, or insufficient tests for risky logic. Should fix; documented if deferred. |
| **Low**      | Style, documentation, naming, minor best-practice gap, optional hardening. Cosmetic; deferral acceptable.                                                                      |
| **Info**     | Positive observation, skipped check, context, or non-blocking recommendation. No action required.                                                                              |

| Info     | All PHTML output passes through `$escaper` (positive)                    |

## Adjustment Rules

- **Raise one level** when:
    - The vulnerable path is reachable without authentication
    - Affected data includes PII or payment information
    - The defect is in a hot path that cannot be disabled

- **Lower one level** when:
    - The affected surface requires admin credentials
    - The issue is theoretical with no confirmed user-controlled input
    - The module is internal/not customer-facing

- **Never lower below Medium** for any confirmed XSS, CSRF, or SQL injection.

## Suspected-but-Unconfirmed Vulnerabilities

When static analysis can't trace the full attack path (e.g. `getParam()` flows through
multiple service layers before a query):

- Report as **Medium** with `[Needs verification]` flag.
- State exactly what is suspicious and which part of the chain is unconfirmed.
- Do not escalate to High without tracing the user-controlled value to the sink.
- Do not suppress to Info if the pattern matches a known dangerous API.
- Suggest a specific manual verification step.

## Output

Every finding must include impact, evidence, recommendation, and a verification or test
suggestion. Severity tagged at the title.
