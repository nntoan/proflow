# Execution Modes (Shared)

How a findings/RCA skill decides whether its analysis runs as parallel **subagents** or
**inline** in the main conversation. Consumed by `m2-audit`, `m2-review`, `m2-security`,
`m2-perf-audit`, `m2-a11y-audit`, `m2-marketplace`, and `m2-fix`. The mode changes only *where* the
work runs — the same references, checklists, and findings schema apply either way.

## The two modes

| Mode | What happens | When it wins |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `agents` | Read-only subagents are dispatched in parallel — `reviewer` (one per findings dimension), `explorer` (comprehension / RCA path-tracing) — and the skill owns synthesis: dedup, severity normalization, conflict tie-breaking. | Large modules, multi-dimension audits, security-sensitive targets. Faster wall-clock; main context stays small. |
| `inline` | The skill executes the same analysis itself, sequentially, in the main conversation. | Small targets, step-by-step steering, token-frugal runs, environments where subagents are unavailable. |

## Selection, in precedence order

1. **Per run** — `--agents` or `--inline` on the invocation, or plain language
   ("in one flow", "without subagents", "use parallel agents", "delegate").
2. **Per project** — `execution_mode` (`"agents"` | `"inline"`) in `.commandcode/m2.json`,
   the plugin's own override file:

   ```json
   { "execution_mode": "agents" }
   ```

   Do **not** read this from Claude Code's `.commandcode/settings.json`. That file is not
   parsed by this plugin, and Claude Code accepts unknown keys there silently — a typo
   would fail without a single diagnostic. `m2.json` is resolved by
   `context/scripts/resolve-context.sh` alongside `magento_root` / `php_container`, so
   the value arrives as the context field `{ctx.execution_mode}` (with its origin in
   `{ctx.resolution_source.execution_mode}`). Read it from the context document you
   already resolved in Phase 0 — never re-read the file yourself.

   `null` means no project preference. A value that is neither `agents` nor `inline`
   also resolves to `null`, with the reason recorded in `resolution_source` — an
   unrecognised mode is an honest gap, never a silently invented execution shape.
3. **Per-skill default** — `m2-audit` defaults to `agents` (its whole point is the
   fan-out); every other consumer defaults to `inline`.

State the chosen mode (and what chose it: flag, `m2.json`, or default) in the run header
of the report. When `resolution_source.execution_mode` records an unresolved value, say
so there too rather than silently falling through to the default.

## Invariants — identical in both modes

- **Approval gates always run in the main conversation.** A gate (RCA approval, deploy
  confirmation, fix authorization) is never delegated to a subagent, in either mode.
- **Same canon.** Both modes read the same reference packs and emit the same
  findings-schema JSON/SARIF via the shared emitters. Scripted scanners
  (`build-findings.sh`) are deterministic and run as scripts in both modes.
- **Read-only agents.** `reviewer` and `explorer` never modify code; only the main
  conversation writes.

## Documented divergence

An inline run can pause and ask the user a clarifying question mid-analysis. A subagent
cannot: in `agents` mode, ambiguities are resolved conservatively and listed in the
report under **Open questions** instead. This difference is inherent, not a bug — pick
`inline` when the target is ambiguous enough that mid-run steering matters.
