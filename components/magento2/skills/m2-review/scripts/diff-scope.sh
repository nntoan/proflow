#!/usr/bin/env bash
# diff-scope.sh — list files changed in a module since a given git ref: committed, staged, unstaged
# and untracked (not ignored) files alike.
#
# Usage:
#   diff-scope.sh <module-path> [<ref>]
#
#   <module-path>  e.g. src/app/code/Acme/OrderS3Export
#   <ref>          git ref (default: origin/main)
#
# Output:
#   Prints one path per line (relative to repo root), filtered to:
#     *.php, *.xml, *.xsd, *.phtml, *.json, *.graphqls, *.html, *.css, *.less, *.js
#   restricted to files inside <module-path>.
#
# Exits 0 if any changed files; 1 if none (allowing callers to short-circuit).

# "Changed" is measured on the WORKING TREE against the point this branch left <ref>: committed,

# commits only, so uncommitted work — the state `m2-feature` runs its R* reviews in, with per-task
# commits off by default — read as "no changed files" and the review stopped with "nothing to
# review". On a clean tree (CI, pull requests) the list is the same as before.
