# compare-findings.sh — diff a re-run against its baseline and emit the closure document.
#
# `verification` has always been a required field on every finding that nothing ever executed.
# This is the run-level counterpart: re-audit, then diff by fingerprint so "we fixed it" is a
# measured claim rather than an optimistic one.
#
# Read-only with respect to the codebase: it reads two findings documents and writes a report.
# It never edits code — `m2-audit` stays an auditor (see its Core Rules).
#
# Inputs (env vars):
#   BASELINE_JSON   findings document from BEFORE the remediation (required)
#   CURRENT_JSON    findings document from the re-run AFTER it (required)
#   TARGET_MODULE   e.g. "Acme_OrderExport" (required)
#   TARGET_PATH     e.g. "app/code/Acme/OrderExport" (required)
#   SCOPE           module (default) | site | vendor
#   DOCS_ROOT       artifact root; default .docs
#   OUTPUT_DIR      default {DOCS_ROOT}/audits
#   WAIVERS_FILE    default {DOCS_ROOT}/findings/waivers.yml
#   RUN_DATE        override the YYYY-MM-DD stamp (tests pin this)
#
# Output:
#   {OUTPUT_DIR}/{TARGET_MODULE}-closure-{date}.json   outputKind=closure
#   {OUTPUT_DIR}/{TARGET_MODULE}-closure-{date}.sarif
#
# Buckets (keyed by fingerprint):
#   closed      in baseline, absent now
#   still_open  in baseline, present now
#   waived      suppressed by waivers.yml — never counted as closed
#   regressed   absent from baseline, present now — introduced by the remediation
#   skipped     raised by a scanner that could not be trusted on the re-run; NEVER closed
