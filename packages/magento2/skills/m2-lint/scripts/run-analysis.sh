#   SCOPE         "module" | "site" | "diff" (default: module)
#   RUNNER        Runner prefix, e.g. "docker compose exec -T php" (default: "")

#   PHPMD         Path to phpmd binary (default: "")
#   RECTOR        Path to rector binary (default: "")
#   PHPSTAN_MEMORY_LIMIT
#                 Value for phpstan's --memory-limit (default: 2G). php.ini's default (commonly
#                 128M) crashes phpstan on a Magento codebase and yields an apparently-clean run.
#   FINDINGS_FILE Output path for the JSON findings array (default: a new temp file, outside any
#                 directory this script removes; the caller owns it)
#   TOOLS_FILE    Optional output path for a JSON object of per-scanner status — "executed",
#                 "unavailable" (binary not found), "skipped" (deliberately not run) or "degraded"
#                 (ran, but its result cannot be trusted as clean). build-findings.sh turns it into
#                 the document's `tools` map.
#
# Output:
#   Writes a JSON array of finding objects (findings-schema.md shape) to FINDINGS_FILE.
