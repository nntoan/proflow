  Review a Magento 2 module or diff for architecture, framework requirements, security, code quality,
  maintainability, PHPDoc, and test coverage. Use when asked to review, validate, or assess a
  module or diff. Environment-independent: needs no Docker, bin/magento, or database. For a full
  multi-dimension release audit use m2-audit; for security-only depth (CVEs, secrets,
  EQP) m2-security; for performance-only depth m2-perf-audit.

# Magento 2 Module Review

Review Magento 2 modules with static evidence first. Use runtime tools only when they are already available and safe. A
missing tool or unavailable Magento runtime is an environment limitation, not a module defect.

## Core Rules

- Treat the module as source under review; do not edit files unless the user asks for fixes.
- Prefer static analysis and direct file inspection over runtime assumptions.
- Do not require Docker, Make, Magento CLI, Composer install, database access, network access, or a running Magento
  instance.
- Use every relevant static-analysis tool that is available locally; skip unavailable tools and report them clearly.
- Avoid reviewing `vendor/` as source unless the user explicitly points to a vendor-distributed module.
- Report findings first, ordered by severity, with file and line references. See
  `references/evidence-citation.md` for citation rules covering grep matches, XML structures,
  missing files, and cross-file findings.
- Separate confirmed defects, recommendations, subjective style notes, and environment limitations.
- Evaluate code style, PHPDoc, DRY, SOLID, KISS, and SRP as maintainability criteria; only escalate when they create
  concrete risk or violate Magento standards.
- **Output budget.** Follow `context/references/output-budget.md` — targeted reads, summary-first test/lint output, long logs to files.

## Workflow

1. Identify module scope.
    - Determine module name from `registration.php`, `etc/module.xml`, or `composer.json`.
    - **If module identity cannot be resolved from any of these three sources, stop immediately.** Report to
      the user which files are missing or malformed. Do not proceed to step 2 with an unknown module.
    - Record path, namespace, package type, Magento version hints, and feature surface.
    - In Claude Code: use the `Read` tool for individual files, `Bash` with `grep -r` for
      targeted pattern searches, and the `Explore` subagent for broad file-tree discovery
      (keeps results out of main context). Avoid `rg` unless confirmed available.
    - After step 1, present a brief module profile (name, path, file counts, surfaces present), then
      continue to step 2 without waiting for acknowledgment unless the user has asked to approve scope
      before proceeding.
    - **Scope selection:** default to **full review** when the user's request contains any of:
      audit, release-readiness, security review, comprehensive, or report.
      Treat output format (HTML, Markdown) as a separate, orthogonal choice — do not use it as a scope signal.
      Default to **quick review** when the user says quick, fast, time-boxed, or brief.
      Ask only when the request is genuinely ambiguous (e.g. bare "review this module").
    - **Large module protocol (>50 PHP files or >150 total files):** read all config XML fully; read every
      file in `Api/`, `Controller/`, `Plugin/`, and `Observer/` fully; sample-read (first 60 lines) all
      remaining PHP files; state the sampling strategy in the report scope section.

2. Build the architecture map.
    - Map registration, Composer metadata, DI, routes/controllers, service contracts, domain models, persistence,
      config, presentation, cron/queue, APIs, GraphQL, plugins, observers, and tests.
    - Use `references/review-checklist.md` as the evaluation source for all tier criteria. Load it on demand
      when entering each tier — do not load it upfront for areas that will not be reached.

3. Run optional static tool passes.
    - Prefer safe file-only commands first: PHP lint, XML lint, JSON validation, Composer validation, grep-pattern
      scans.
    - Run Magento/PHP tooling only if present: PHPCS, PHPMD, PHPStan, Psalm, PHPUnit, Rector dry-run, Semgrep.
    - Use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/static-tool-probe.sh` to list available tools and suggested commands without
      assuming they exist.
    - Use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/discover-module.sh <module-path>` for a quick source inventory.
    - Use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/collect-evidence.sh <module-path>` for grep-based risk and surface scans.
    - **Script output:** summarise grep/tool output to the top 30 most relevant file:line references before proceeding.
      Do not dump raw script output into context; extract only patterns that warrant further investigation.
    - See `references/static-analysis-tools.md` for the full command list and failure-classification rules.

4. Review code quality and architecture.
    - Validate Magento architectural requirements and framework best practices.
    - Check security, persistence, API boundaries, DI patterns, frontend escaping, admin ACL/config, cron/queue safety,
      and test coverage.
    - Check code style and PHPDoc against `references/phpdoc-code-style.md`.
    - Check DRY/SOLID/KISS/SRP and separation of concerns as maintainability concerns.

5. Produce a report.
    - Use findings-first structure: severity, impact, evidence, recommendation, verification.
    - Include tool results and skipped checks.
    - For Markdown output: use `references/report-template.md`.
    - For HTML output: use `templates/report.html`. Load this file only when the user requests HTML.
    - For JSON output (default when invoked from another skill or with `--format=json`):
      build the findings array per `context/references/findings-schema.md`, then
      pipe it through `${COMMANDCODE_SKILL_DIR}/../m2-context/scripts/emit-json.sh`. Writes to
      `{output_root}/reviews/{Vendor}_{Module}-review-{date}.json` — anchored at the project
      root, never under `{ctx.magento_root}`. `{output_root}` is the `--docs-root` value when
      the caller passed one, else `{ctx.docs_root}`. Run as:
      `DOCS_ROOT="${DOCS_ROOT_ARG:-docs}" bash "${COMMANDCODE_SKILL_DIR}/../m2-context/scripts/emit-json.sh"`
      (where `DOCS_ROOT_ARG` is the resolved `--docs-root` value) so an in-`src/` cwd cannot
      redirect output into the Magento tree. See "Output Root" below.
    - For SARIF output (CI / GitHub Code Scanning): run `${COMMANDCODE_SKILL_DIR}/../m2-context/scripts/emit-sarif.sh` on the JSON
      output. Writes alongside the JSON file with `.sarif` extension.
    - Update `Reviewer:` to `Claude Code using review` and include the
      `Skill versions:` block from `references/report-template.md`.

6. If fixes are requested.
    - First route every finding and recommendation per the **Fix Routing** table below. Invoke the
      routed skill for each item it owns; only items the table marks inline are fixed in this skill.
    - Fix inline items in severity order: Critical first, then High, then Medium, then Low. Do not
      silently drop any severity level — anything not fixed is listed as residual risk in the v2 report.
    - Keep each change scoped to its confirmed finding. Do not clean up surrounding code.
    - After each fix, rerun the best available static check on the modified file before proceeding to the
      next finding. If a fix introduces a new finding, report it to the user rather than fixing it silently.
    - Add/update tests for behaviour changes.
    - Create a v2 report summarising resolved findings, items delegated to other skills (naming the
      skill per item), and residual risk.

### Output root (`--docs-root`)

This skill accepts `--docs-root=<path>` (see
`context/references/artifact-layout.md`). When set, run the emitter with
`DOCS_ROOT=<path>` so artifacts land under `<path>/reviews/`; otherwise they default
to `{ctx.docs_root}/reviews/`. Orchestrators such as `m2-feature`
pass this to collect a run's artifacts under one folder.

## Fix Routing

When the user asks to act on findings or report recommendations, route each item to the skill
that owns that work before touching code. The mapping is a **contract, not a judgement call** —
it lives in `context/references/fix-routing.md` and is resolved by
`context/scripts/route-finding.sh`. Do not restate it here and do not pick an
executing skill ad hoc.

```
route-finding.sh --skill=review --category=<finding.category> \
                 [--subcategory=<sub>] [--severity=<sev>] [--file=<evidence path>]
  → owner<TAB>gate<TAB>rationale
```

- Invoke the routed skill with the finding's `file:line` evidence, its `fingerprint`, and the
  report path, so it does not re-derive the diagnosis.
- `gate: auto` may be applied within an approved batch; `gate: manual` items are **never**
  executed automatically — report them as human actions (e.g. rotating a leaked credential,
  which deleting the code does not do).
- `owner: unrouted` means no row matched. Report it as unrouted — never fall back to
  `m2-fix` by guesswork.
- `owner: inline` means this skill fixes it directly, in severity order, per step 6 above.
- Exception — invoked from another skill: when this review ran in diff mode on behalf of
  `m2-feature`, `m2-fix`, or `m2-upgrade`, return findings to the calling skill
  instead of routing; the caller owns remediation.
- To route a whole report rather than one finding, use `m2-triage`, which applies
  waivers, gates by confidence, and emits an ordered remediation plan.

## Diff Mode

Use when the user invokes with `--diff [<ref>]` or when this skill is called from
`m2-feature` / `m2-fix` / `m2-upgrade` after a
code change. Read `references/diff-mode.md` for the full algorithm.

- Run `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/diff-scope.sh <module-path> <ref>` (default ref `origin/main`) to obtain
  the changed-file list — committed, uncommitted and untracked changes since the branch left `<ref>`,
  so a review run straight after a task sees that task's uncommitted work. If exit 1, report "no
  findings — nothing to review" and stop.
- Restrict architecture mapping, tool passes, and checklist application to the changed
  files. Cross-file findings cite the outside file with `crossFile: true`.
- JSON output sets `mode: "diff"` and includes `diffRef` in `target`.
- Report scope reads "Diff against `<ref>` — N files".

## Quick Review Mode

Use when the user requests a quick review, or after the step-1 profile check when the user confirms. A module qualifies
for quick review when it has **fewer than 20 PHP files AND none of** `webapi.xml`, `etc/schema.graphqls`,
`etc/frontend/routes.xml`, or `etc/adminhtml/routes.xml` present — any of these files warrants a full review regardless
of size.

Cover all **Tier 1 areas** (matching the checklist) plus a registration sanity check. Do not include Testing (Tier 2) in
quick reviews.

- **Security:** ACL, CSRF, escaping, input validation, secrets, SQL safety.
- **Persistence and setup:** declarative schema, parameterised queries, idempotent patches, schema whitelist.
- **Dependency injection:** constructor injection only, no ObjectManager in production code, proxies for heavy deps.
- **Controllers and CSRF:** HTTP interface compliance, form-key validation, GET idempotency, explicit authorisation.
- **Service contracts and APIs:** ACL on all exposed endpoints, anonymous access justified, no raw-array API types.
- **Registration sanity:** `registration.php`, `composer.json`, `etc/module.xml` — naming, constraints, autoload.

Note explicitly which Tier 2 and 3 areas were skipped. If any Critical or High finding appears, recommend a full review.

## Execution Mode

Default: **auto** — `agents` when the plugin's context-budget hook reports this conversation
above its threshold, `inline` otherwise. `--agents` (or `execution_mode` in `.commandcode/m2.json`, surfaced as
`{ctx.execution_mode}`) dispatches one
read-only `m2-reviewer` subagent per review dimension and this skill owns synthesis — the
selection contract, precedence, and invariants are in
`context/references/execution-modes.md`. Read `references/parallel-review.md` before
delegating: it defines the subtask split, tie-breaking, and model guidance.

## Severity

Use the shared five-point scale (Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info) defined in
`context/references/severity.md` — including its adjustment rules and the
suspected-but-unconfirmed handling. Every finding must include impact, evidence,
recommendation, and a verification or test suggestion. See `references/severity-examples.md`
for the Magento-specific calibration matrix.
