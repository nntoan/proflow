# CHANGELOG Format (Canonical)

This is the single structural authority for every module `CHANGELOG.md` produced or
touched by the magento2-tools skill pack. `m2-docs` renders it (scaffold),
`m2-release` populates it (commit → category mapping, generation procedure), and
`m2-module-create` delegates to `m2-docs` for it. Do not fork this
structure elsewhere — skills that need CHANGELOG behaviour cite this file.

Following Keep a Changelog (https://keepachangelog.com).
