  Read-only: turns a Magento 2 audit/review/security/performance findings report into an ordered,
  approvable remediation plan, each finding routed to the skill owning its fix. Use for a fix plan,
  to ask who should fix findings, or to triage a report. Never re-scans or edits code. Consumes
  m2-audit output; hand the plan to m2-remediate or the owning skill (e.g.
  m2-fix). Fresh findings: m2-review, m2-security or
  m2-perf-audit.

# Magento 2 Findings Triage

`m2-audit` and its sibling findings skills answer *what is wrong*. This skill answers
**what to do about it, in what order, and who does it** — and it answers with a document
a human can approve rather than a conversation that has to be re-held every run.

It is the read-only half of the remediation cycle:

```
audit / review / security / perf-audit  ──►  triage  ──►  remediate  ──►  audit --compare
        (what is wrong)                     (the plan)    (the work)      (what closed)
```

## Core Rules

- **Read-only.** Never edits a module, never writes to `vendor/`, never runs a fix. The only
  thing it writes is its own plan under the output root.
- **JSON is the contract; Markdown is never parsed.** The Markdown report is for humans. Every
  decision is made from the JSON findings document (`context/references/findings-schema.md`).
- **Never guess an owner.** Routing is resolved by `context/scripts/route-finding.sh`
  over the matrix in `context/references/fix-routing.md`. A finding with no matching
  row is reported in `unrouted[]` — it is never quietly defaulted to `m2-fix`.
- **A waived finding is reported, never dropped.** It lands in `waived[]` with its verdict,
  reason and author, and is never counted as closed. An **expired** waiver resurfaces the
  finding instead of continuing to suppress it.
- **Only `confidence: confirmed` is schedulable.** A `candidate` or `needs-triage` finding is
  evidence to re-check, not work to book, so it is held in `verify_first[]`.
- **Nothing is silently discarded.** A finding filtered out by `--severity` or an owner filter
  is recorded in `skipped[]` with the reason.
- **Artifact location.** This skill accepts `--docs-root=<path>` (see
  `context/references/artifact-layout.md`). When set, run the builder with
  `DOCS_ROOT=<path>` so the plan lands under `<path>/remediation/`; otherwise it defaults to
  `{ctx.docs_root}/remediation/`.

## Workflow

### Phase 0 — Context

Invoke `m2-context` once. Capture `vendor`, `docs_root`, and `theme.breeze`
(the Breeze predicate changes who owns a frontend finding).

### Phase 1 — Ingest

Resolve the input document:

| `--from` value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| *omitted* | Newest `{output_root}/audits/*-audit-*.json`. |
| a findings `.json` | That document. |
| a directory | Every `*.json` in it, merged (per-dimension reports from one run). A `*.sarif` is read only when it has no `.json` sibling — the JSON is strictly richer. |
| a `.sarif` log | Its results, including SARIF produced by CI or a third-party scanner. |

Validate `schemaVersion`: a **major** mismatch is a hard error (exit 4) — the field semantics
are not ours to guess; a **minor** one warns, is recorded in `scanner_errors[]`, and the run
continues.

**Markdown is never an input** — it is the human view; JSON is the contract.

**SARIF is a deliberately degraded input.** It carries no `confidence`, `recommendation` or
`verification`, so every finding read from one is forced to `confidence: needs-triage` and
held in `verify_first[]` by Phase 4 — a SARIF finding can be *routed and reported* but can
**never** enter a batch or drive an automated patch. A CI scanner's output is evidence, not
a diagnosis. Our own SARIF stays identifiable across the round trip because the emitter
writes the fingerprint to `partialFingerprints["m2FindingFingerprint/v1"]` and keeps the
finding category in the rule's `name`; a foreign SARIF has neither, so its findings are
fingerprinted from what they do carry and will not match a waiver written against a JSON
report.

### Phase 2 — Fingerprint

Read each finding's `fingerprint`; a pre-1.1 document is fingerprinted on the fly with
`findings-lib.sh::finding_fingerprint`. Findings sharing a fingerprint across input
documents collapse into one entry that keeps the **highest** severity and records every
producer that raised it.

### Phase 3 — Waivers

Load `{output_root}/findings/waivers.yml` (or `--waivers=<path>`) and apply it:

| Waiver state | Result |
|---|---|
| active | `waived[]`, with verdict / reason / author. Never counted closed. |
| expired | `verify_first[]`, noted `waiver expired <date>`. |
| matches no current finding | reported in `stale_waivers[]` so dead entries get pruned. |

If the waivers file is gitignored or untracked, the run warns that the suppressions are local
only and will reset — commit the file or relocate it with `--waivers=`.

### Phase 4 — Confidence gate

`confirmed` → routable. Anything else → `verify_first[]` with the reason.

### Phase 5 — Route

One `route-finding.sh` call per finding, keyed on producer, category, subcategory,
severity, evidence file and the Breeze predicate. `unrouted` → `unrouted[]`.

### Phase 6 — Batch

Group routable findings by owner **and gate**, order the groups per
`references/plan-format.md`, and sort within a group by severity descending.
`--include` / `--exclude` filter batches without changing their relative order.

### Phase 7 — Emit and present

Run `scripts/build-plan.sh`, then present the plan for approval: batch order, owner and
gate per batch, the counts in each bucket, and the `gate: manual` items called out as human
actions (a burned credential needs rotation, not just a patch). Approval is what turns a
plan into work — this skill stops here.

## Inputs

```
/triage [--from=<path>] [--waivers=<path>] [--severity=<min>]
        [--include=<owner,…>] [--exclude=<owner,…>] [--docs-root=<path>]
        [<Vendor>_<Module>]
```

Flags map onto `scripts/build-plan.sh` env vars:

| Flag | Env var |
|---|---|
| `--from=` | `INPUT_JSON` |
| `--waivers=` | `WAIVERS_FILE` |
| `--severity=` | `MIN_SEVERITY` |
| `--include=` | `INCLUDE_OWNERS` |
| `--exclude=` | `EXCLUDE_OWNERS` |
| `--docs-root=` | `DOCS_ROOT` |
| `<Vendor>_<Module>` | `TARGET_MODULE` + `TARGET_PATH` |

## Outputs

`{output_root}/remediation/{Vendor}_{Module}-plan-{YYYY-MM-DD}.{json,sarif}` with
`outputKind=remediation`, plus a Markdown plan sharing the basename — the approval
artifact. Shape and buckets: `references/plan-format.md`.

## Reference Files

- `references/plan-format.md` — the `outputKind=remediation` document, its four buckets,
  and the batch-order rationale.
- `context/references/fix-routing.md` — the routing matrix itself (finding → owning skill).
- `context/references/findings-schema.md` — the findings document this skill consumes and
  the `remediation` output kind it emits.
- `context/references/severity.md` — the shared five-point severity scale.
- `context/references/artifact-layout.md` — the output root and filename scheme.

## Scripts

- `scripts/build-plan.sh` — ingest → waive → gate → route → batch → emit.
- `scripts/inject-plan-sections.sh` — `POST_JSON_HOOK` that adds the plan's top-level
  buckets to the emitted document.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Produces `{Vendor}_{Module}-plan-{date}.json` with `outputKind=remediation`, per-finding
  `owner` / `gate` / `batch` / `routing_rationale` / `status` / `source_finding`, and the
  top-level `batches[]`, `waived[]`, `verify_first[]`, `unrouted[]`, `stale_waivers[]`.
- Every ingested finding appears in exactly one bucket; none is dropped.
- `m2-lint` is always the last batch, and `m2-upgrade` (when present) the first.
- No file outside `{output_root}/remediation/` is created or modified.
