# Feature Folder Structure

Part of the `m2-feature` skill — read at Phase 2 (folder creation), and whenever you write or look for a feature artifact.

Every feature gets its own subfolder under `docs/`. Create it at the start of Phase 2.

**Location.** `docs/` is anchored at the **project working directory** (`{ctx.docs_root}` =
`{project_root}/docs`), as defined by the **Artifact location** rule in
`context/SKILL.md`. Never create it under `{ctx.magento_root}` (e.g. `src/`),
`app/code`, or any module directory. When `magento_root` is `src`, the folder is
`./docs/{FeatureName}/`, a sibling of `src/` — not `src/docs/{FeatureName}/`.

```
docs/                        # at the project root — never inside the Magento tree

> Sub-skill artifacts nest by category under the feature root per
> `context/references/artifact-layout.md`.

**plan.md** is the single source of truth for resuming a run interrupted **from outside** — a lost
session, a crash, an explicit stop by the user. It must always contain:

- The implementation flow diagram (Mermaid `flowchart TD`)
- The module schema diagram (Mermaid `graph TD`)
- The task dependency graph (Mermaid `graph LR`)
- A **Current State** section listing every task as a checkbox (`- [ ]` pending / `- [x]` done).

After each task completes in Phase 5, mark its checkbox `[x]` in `plan.md` and save immediately,
then continue straight into the next task. `plan.md` exists so an **externally** interrupted run
can be picked up — it is not a licence to interrupt the run yourself (Core Rules →
**Continuous execution**).
